### About

Hello 👋 I’m isfjdev — short for Nguyễn Minh Nguyên, a software engineer based in Vietnam.
I specialize in building reliable and pragmatic software solutions using Go and JavaScript, with a focus on remote-first development.

Outside of work, I’m a proud father of two — a curious 3-year-old boy and a bright 6-year-old girl — who continually inspire me with lessons in patience, creativity, and lifelong learning.

In my free time, I recharge through traveling, photography, and reading — passions that fuel both my personal growth and professional mindset.
