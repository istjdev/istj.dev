### About

Hello ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m istjdev â€” short for Nguyá»…n Minh NguyÃªn, a software engineer based in Vietnam.
I specialize in building reliable and pragmatic software solutions using Go and JavaScript, with a focus on remote-first development.

Outside of work, Iâ€™m a proud father of two â€” a curious 3-year-old boy and a bright 6-year-old girl â€” who continually inspire me with lessons in patience, creativity, and lifelong learning.

In my free time, I recharge through traveling, photography, and reading â€” passions that fuel both my personal growth and professional mindset.
